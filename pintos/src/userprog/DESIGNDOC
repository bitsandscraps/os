we got to know that we should change process_wait to infinite loop before
anything starts to work.

			   ARGUMENT PASSING

Did not changed any data structured. If you can call macro a data
structure, we defined one macro.

/* The length of the array to store each argument during tokenizing
 * the given string. */
#define MAX_ARGC 64

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

First we strtok_r the given string to tokenize the name of the program,
and passed it to load. Second we kept strtok_r other parts of the string
and stored each token in the array of size MAX_ARGC. Then using the
array, we carefully arranged the arguments on the stack of the new
process.
  The string that the kernel passes to a process is maximum 128
characters long(LOADER_ARGS_LEN defined in threads/init.c). So the
maximum number of arguments will be 128 / 2 = 64, since there should be
at least one space between every arguments. So the whole argv array
cannot exceed (64 + 1) * 4 bytes, where 1 is the null pointer sentinel.
The left members of argument passing is argv, argc, and return address,
which is of total 12 bytes. So size of the whole argument passing stack
cannot exceed 128 + (64 + 1) * 4 + 12 = 784 bytes, which is much smaller
than the size of a page, 4 KB. The stack page will never overflow.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok uses a static pointer to tokenize string. Since pintos is a
multi-threaded environment, it is very likely for race conditions to
occur and corrupt the results.

                              ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration. Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

A "fd_elem" is used to manage the file descriptors opened
by a particular process.

    struct fd_elem
    {
      int fd;                   /* assigned fd number */
      off_t pos;                /* offset for read and write */
      struct file * file;       /* struct file for the fd */
      struct list_elem elem;    /* list element of open_fds in struct thread */
    };

A child is an element of the children list managed by every thread.

    struct child
    {
      tid_t tid;
      struct thread * thr;
      struct list_elem elem;
    };

A start_proc_args is the data structure used to exchange data between
a parent and its child.

  struct start_proc_args
  {
    char * file_name;
    bool success;
    struct thread * parent;
    struct thread * child;
  };


Lock to avoid race conditions on file system manipulations.

    static struct lock filesys_lock;

typedef of pid_t. In our implementation pid of a process is the
tid of its thread.

    typedef int pid_t;

Added to struct thread:

    /* For denying writes on executables. */
    struct file * executable;     /* The executable file of itself. */

    /* Data Structures for Managing File Descriptors. */
    struct list open_fds;         /* List of open files. */
    /* max_fd is always greater or equal to any files in open_fds.
     * This value is used to assign fd values to new files. */
    int max_fd;
    /* fd_lock must be acquired before modifying file descriptors. */
    struct lock fd_lock;

    /* Data Structues for Implementing Wait. */
    int exit_status;              /* Status of exit. */
    /* The value is 'up'ed when everything is over. */
    struct semaphore is_done;
    /* The value is 'up'ed when parent calls wait. */
    struct semaphore wait_parent;
    /* The value is 'up'ed when the data is ready for its parent. */
    struct semaphore wait_process;
    struct list children;         /* Children of the current process. */

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.

>> single process?

It is unique just within a process. Even the pos value determined by
seek system call is unique just within a process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

We used the second method introduced in section 3.1.5 of Pintos manual.
It uses the MMU of the kernel. We changed the code so that when MMU
detects a page fault, it does not kill the process immediately but
store -1 in the eax register, for the kernel to verify whether the given
address is valid. Every time the kernel reads or writes user data, it
first check whether the given virtual address is anywhere sensible
(surely it cannot exceed PHYS_BASE). If it looks okay, it justs reads
or writes on that address. But before continuing, the kernel checks
whether or not the MMU has returned -1. If it has returned -1, the
kernel kills the process.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

Every time a process executes a child process, it records the pointer
to the struct thread of its child and add it to the children list.
When wait is called it checks whether it has a child of the given pid.
If it doesn't, exit immediately. If it does, wait for the child to be
ready for exit, which is possible because the parent knows the pointer
to the struct thread of its child. When the child signals the parent
that everything is over, the parent signals the child through the
semaphore element wait_parent in the child's struct thread that it can
now safely terminate.
  Now from the child's perspective. When everything is over, it signals
the parent through the semaphore element is_done in its struct thread.
Then it waits for the parent to call wait. When the semaphore element
wait_parent is 'up'ed by the parent, it completes the termination
process.

All of the temporarily allocated resources must be freed before exiting.
So we just put all those code in syscall_exit, and called it before
returning from an error. One exception is the lock for the file system.
This one, we released it manually, since the exit system call is totally
irrelevant to the file system.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

To implement wait system call, we added some code to allow data exchange
between the parent and child threads. After finding out that our
implementation cannot catch the load failure, we just added a success
flag to the set of data exchanged between parent and child.
  The data exchanged occur by the following procedure. The parent
parent process allocates a page for struct start_proc_args. It fills the
struct contents with the pointer to the process name and the pointer to
its struct thread. And waits on the semaphore element wait_process. The
child receives this struct though aux of thread_create. After trying to
load the process, it returns whether it succeeded or not with the
pointer to its struct thread. And using the pointer to the parent's
struct thread, it signals the parent that it has finished filling up the
required struct elements.

We ensure synchronization through semaphore elements is_done and
wait_parent.
  If P calls wait(C) before C exits, C is not done yet, so P will wait
for C to 'up' its is_done. P reads the exit code and 'up's C's
wait_parent so that C can terminate.
  If C exits before P calls wait(C), C will 'up' its is_done and wait
for its parent to 'up' wait_parent. When P calls wait(C), it will see
that C is ready for exit, read C's exit code, and signals C to terminate
via 'up'ing C's wait_parent.
  The child waits for its parent to call wait after all the resources
are freed, so we can ensure that no resources are locked forever.
  If the parent does not call wait(C) but exit, the kernel cannot reap
those zombie children. It is the user's responsibility to reap the
zombie processes. We just followed the implementation of unix.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

The user manual states that this approach is much faster because it
takes advantage of the MMU.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

It is simple. We recorded the maximum file descriptor value in struct
thread. Every time we assign a file descriptor, we just increment that
value and give it to the new file. This value is always manipulated
after acquiring the fd_lock of the thread. We did not decremented the
max_fd value when we close a file. Since it has to check whether the
closing fd is the maximum value or not. If it was not the maximum
value, the maximum value fd is not closed yet, so we cannot assign that
number to another file. We can clearly see that it makes things a lot
complicated.
  In our implementation, after opening 2147483647 files the file
descriptor values might malfunction, even when the process only has few
open file descriptors. But we strongly believe that it will never
happen.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

Did not change the mapping. It makes implementation much simpler and
compatible with the given process-related functions.
